	<h2> We are looking for Interview Participants</h2>
<p>Do you work as a developer or a stakeholder in developing security and privacy enhancing software like VPN, TOR, Password Managers, etc,? We would love to interview you about your experiences with assessing ethical impacts of security and privacy software.</p>
<p>We are a group of researchers from <a href="https://www.gwu.edu/" rel="noopener">The George Washington University</a> working at the <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/" rel="noopener">George Washington University Usable Security and Privacy (GWUSEC) lab</a>. We are studying the ethical impacts of privacy and security software from a developers' perspective. You do not need to be actively working on ethics to participate, we would just like to listen to your perspectives on ethics.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context <a href="/ethicalimpactproject/#context" class="anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>A lot of Security and Privacy Software are developed with the intention to have a positive impact on people, e.g., to protect them from surveillance, to protect them from vulnerabilities, to keep them safe etc. However, there may be negative unintended and ethical consequences by the wide distribution of this software. For instance, use of dark patterns in cookie banners and consent forms, risk of bias in facial biometric systems are some examples of these consequences. We currently do not know how development teams try to mitigate these consequences. We want to understand how and if developers systematically prevent these consequences.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-interview">About the interview <a href="/ethicalimpactproject/#about-the-interview" class="anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>We are interested in your opnions and experiences with respect to dealing with the broader ethical and negative consequences of security and privacy software. The interview questions are designed in such a way to understand your experiences and perceptions with handling ethical impacts your solutions.</p>
<p>We are in no way judging your current processes and opinions, we are just interested in understanding how you look at certain ethical aspects and how they are currently dealt with. We are just trying to ascertain the underlying perceptions, processes, responsibilites associated with ethics in the privacy and security software space. We would also like you hear your opinions about how ethical impacts can be assess and mitigated. Therefore, it is completely fine if you have no previous experience with ethics in your project.</p>
<p>The interview will use a semi-structured approach, we have a bunch of questions to help us navigate through the conversation. </p>

<h3 id="example-questions">Example questions <a href="/ethicalimpactproject/#example-questions" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>Some example questions that we may ask during the interview are</p>
<p><i> <strong>S1Q1</strong> What solution/ tool are you working on? </br>
<strong>S1Q3</strong> What is your role within your development team</br>
<strong>S2Q1</strong> Who are the Primary users of your tool? </br>
<strong>S4Q2</strong> Does your tool collect personal data? if yes, then how do you protect personal data? </br>
<strong>S6Q4</strong> Who do you think should be accountable for assesing ethical risks? </br></i></p>

<h3 id="data-handling">Data Handling <a href="/ethicalimpactproject/#data-handling" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>We would like to record the interview if you consent to it. The recording will help us create transcriptions to analyse the data systematically after the interview. Here is how we will handle your data and transcripts:</p>
<li> The recording of your interview, which will be destroyed after we create the transcripts a few days after the interview.</li>
<li> Your personally identifiable information including name will not be collected as part of the study.</li>
<li> Since participant names will not be recorded, codes such as P001, P002 etc will be used to report the results.</li>
<p>The interview &amp; data handling process was approved by IRB:</p>
<li> During all research, data access is restricted to the research team lead by Dr. Yasemin Acar and Harshini Sri Ramulu. </li>
<li> All collected data is handled according to strict GDPR/DSGVO regulations. </li>
